## Why?

Because I want to make a decent documents out of automatic captions of my YouTube videos and I want to speed up a little bit that process.

## What?

This bash shell wrapper script will delete all position markers and empty lines and merge all that into one gigantic piece of text.

## How?

Usage: `squash-sbv captions.sbv [EXTENSION]`

## Misc

If you don't fancy *GNU/Linux command-line* you could try [online captions converter](http://captionsconverter.com/ "Captions Converter").
