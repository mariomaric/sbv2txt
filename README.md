## Why?

Because I wanted to make a decent documents out of automatic captions of my YouTube videos and I wanted to speed up a little bit that process.

## What?

It will delete all position markers and empty lines (except the last one) and merge all that into one gigantic piece of text.

## How?

`squash-sbv captions.sbv [extension]`

If you don't fancy *GNU/Linux command line* you should try [online captions converter](http://captionsconverter.com/ "Captions Converter") instead.
